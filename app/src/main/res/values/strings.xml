Ligue 1 is generally regarded as competently run, with good planning of fixtures, complete and consistently enforced rules, timely resolution of issues, and adequate escalation procedures of judicial disputes to national or international institutions.\n\n The league has faced three significant corruption scandals in its history (Antibes in 1933, Red Star in the 1950s, and Marseille in 1993) and has preserved its reputation every time through swift and appropriately severe punishment of the guilty parties.\n\n

        <item>Serie A, also called Serie A TIM due to sponsorship by Telecom Italia, is a professional league competition for football clubs located at the top of the Italian football league system and has been operating for over eighty years since the 1929–30 season.\n\n It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010, but a new league, the Lega Serie A, was created for the 2010–11 season.\n\n Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world.\n\n Serie A was considered the best league in the world in the \'90s, and has produced the highest number of European Cup finalists: Italian clubs have reached the final of the competition on a record twenty-six different occasions, winning the title twelve times.\n\n Serie A is ranked 4th among European leagues according to UEFA\'s league coefficient behind the Spanish La Liga, English Premier League and German Bundesliga, which is based on the performance of Italian clubs in the Champions League and the Europa League.\n\n It also ranked 5th in world according to the first trends of the 2011 IFFHS rating.\n\n

        <item>Major League Soccer (MLS) is a professional soccer league representing the sport\'s highest level in both the United States and Canada.\n\n MLS constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada.\n\n The league is composed of 20 teams—17 in the U.\n\nS.\n\n and 3 in Canada.\n\n The MLS regular season runs from March to October, with each team playing 34 games; the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters\' Shield.\n\n The post season includes twelve teams competing in the MLS Cup Playoffs through November and December, culminating in the championship game, the MLS Cup.\n\n MLS teams also play in other competitions against teams from other divisions and countries, such as the U.\n\nS.\n\n Open Cup, the Canadian Championship, and the CONCACAF Champions League.\n\n MLS is sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation (U.\n\nS.\n\n Soccer).\n\n
Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 as part of the United States\' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup.\n\n The first season took place in 1996 with ten teams.\n\n MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years: The league lost millions of dollars, teams played in mostly empty American football stadiums, and two teams folded in 2002.\n\n Since then, MLS has expanded to 20 teams, owners built soccer-specific stadiums, average attendance at MLS matches exceeds that of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL), MLS secured national TV contracts, and the league is now profitable.\n\n
Instead of operating as an association of independently owned teams, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league\'s investors.\n\n The investor-operators control their teams as owners control teams in other leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) referred to as the team\'s owners.\n\n The league\'s closed membership makes it one of the world\'s few soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, which is uncommon in North America.\n\n MLS headquarters are in New York City.\n\n

Since the league\'s inaugural season, a total of six clubs have been crowned A-League Premiers and five clubs have been crowned A-League Champions.\n\n The current premiers and champions are Brisbane Roar, who won both titles in 2013–14.\n\n

There are 24 clubs in Football League One.\n\n Each club plays every other club twice (once at home and once away).\n\n Three points are awarded for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss.\n\n At the end of the season a table of the final League standings is determined, based on the following criteria in this order: points obtained, goal difference, goals scored, an aggregate of the results between two or more clubs (ranked using the previous three criteria) and, finally, a series of one or more play-off matches.\n\n
At the end of each season the top two clubs, together with the winner of the play-offs between the clubs which finished in 3rd–6th position, are promoted to Football League Championship and are replaced by the three clubs that finished at the bottom of that division.\n\n
